# DNA Beneficiaries — Licensing vs Sale Policy

**Purpose:**  
This document outlines the guiding principles for licensing or selling domains and terminology associated with the *DNA Beneficiaries* concept. It exists to provide clarity to potential partners while preserving long-term optionality for the originator.

This is a policy statement, not an offer.

---

## Core Position

The *DNA Beneficiaries* term and related domains are considered **category-defining intellectual property**. As such, licensing is the preferred engagement model. Sale is considered only under specific conditions.

---

## Licensing (Preferred)

Licensing allows third parties to use the terminology and associated domains **without transferring ownership**.

Licensing may include:
- Domain forwarding or co-branded usage
- White-label inclusion in legal or fiduciary materials
- Educational or informational deployment
- Non-exclusive or limited-exclusive arrangements

### Why Licensing Is Preferred
- Preserves originator control
- Allows multiple parallel use cases
- Avoids premature valuation of an early category
- Supports long-term ecosystem growth

Licensing terms, duration, scope, and fees are determined on a case-by-case basis.

---

## Sale (Conditional)

Outright sale of a *DNA Beneficiaries* domain may be considered only when:

- The buyer demonstrates a legitimate, aligned use case
- The buyer has capacity to steward the concept responsibly
- The sale reflects **category value**, not speculative pricing
- Licensing is not sufficient for the buyer’s needs

Sale discussions are selective and not guaranteed.

---

## What This Policy Does Not Do

This policy does **not**:
- Offer legal, fiduciary, or compliance services
- Grant usage rights automatically
- Establish pricing schedules
- Create obligations to sell or license

All engagements require separate written agreement.

---

## Intent and Timing

The *DNA Beneficiaries* concept exists at the intersection of inheritance, precious metals, and tokenized assets — an area still forming.

This policy intentionally favors:
- Patience over urgency
- Clarity over hype
- Stewardship over short-term gain

---

## Closing Statement

Ownership of language shapes future systems.

Licensing allows language to spread responsibly.  
Sale is reserved for moments when permanence, alignment, and value converge.

This policy may evolve as the category matures.
