PAXG Notes — Understanding How PAX Gold Works

General educational reference for the Microscopic Gold ecosystem.

1. What is PAXG?

PAX Gold (PAXG) is a digital asset issued by Paxos Trust Company.
Each token is backed 1:1 by physical gold bars stored in London vaults.

A single PAXG token represents:

One troy ounce of gold (≈31.1035 grams)

Fully allocated ownership (not pooled)

Verifiable on-chain via Ethereum

This makes PAXG one of the most transparent, regulated, and asset-backed digital commodities available.

Microscopic Gold uses PAXG conceptually to demonstrate fractional gold ownership — the idea that “value can finally fit everyone.”

2. PAXG Is Highly Divisible

A full PAXG token is 1 troy ounce of gold, but PAXG is divisible to 18 decimal places, meaning:

You do not need to purchase a whole ounce

You can hold extremely small fractions for educational or conceptual purposes

This is the foundation of the Microscopic Gold ethos — tiny values still matter.

3. Why Exchanges Use Purchase Minimums

Even though PAXG itself is divisible, platforms impose their own rules:

Crypto.com: minimum purchase is usually around $10

Kraken: varies, commonly $5–$10

Binance: minimum trade sizes apply but allow fractional amounts

Brokerages or fintech apps: may require even higher minimums

These limits are platform rules, not PAXG rules.

Important:
The Microscopic Gold concept is not tied to any exchange.
It highlights the philosophy of micro-value — not guaranteeing platform thresholds.

4. Transfers Can Be Smaller Than Purchases

Once PAXG is purchased:

You can transfer much smaller amounts than you can buy

Some platforms support micro-withdrawals

Peer-to-peer flows (including “drops”) can occur at smaller scales

Wrappers on Layer 2s can enable even finer distribution

This is why paxgdrops makes conceptual sense even if initial purchases must meet exchange minimums.

5. Costs, Fees & Practical Limits

A practical note for readers:

Ethereum (Mainnet) Gas

PAXG lives on Ethereum, so transfers on mainnet often cost:

$4–$10 in gas (sometimes more)

This makes micro-transfers impractical on mainnet.

However:

Layer 2 networks (L2s) and wrapped versions

When exchanges implement L2 support (or wrapped variants emerge):

transfers become far cheaper

micro-distributions become financially realistic

educational usage becomes accessible

This is where the Microscopic Gold vision leans — future-facing micro-utility, not present-day fee structures.

6. The Role of PAXG in the Microscopic Gold Ecosystem

PAXG enables:

micro-savings (conceptual jars)

micro-ownership lessons

branded drops (paxgdrops)

paydirt-inspired digital discoveries

experiments in merchant acceptance (weacceptpaxg)

But it does not imply:

financial advice

investment solicitation

custody services

trading platforms

Microscopic Gold is educational + conceptual, not transactional.
