# Example — The “Thank You” Gold Drop  
*A MicroscopicGold Parable*

Derrick helped his neighbor, Mrs. Lawson, carry boxes to her car during a last-minute move.  
He refused payment — it was just the decent thing to do.

Later that evening, his phone buzzed with a notification:

**“You received a paxgdrop: $2.00 in microscopic gold.”**

Mrs. Lawson had sent a tiny thank-you gesture, not large enough to feel like payment, but meaningful enough to feel like gratitude.  
It wasn’t cash… it was **value that stays valuable**, something almost symbolic.

Derrick smiled.  
Not because of the amount, but because of what it represented:

A new way to say “I appreciate you,” using something rare, ancient, and lasting — delivered instantly, without apps or platforms in the way.

PAXGDrops turns generosity into something people can **hold onto**.
A small act, a small gift, a **big feeling**.
