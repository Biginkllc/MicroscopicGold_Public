# Example — # Example — The Micro-Gold Barter Swap  
*A MicroscopicGold Parable*

Jasmine repairs bikes out of her garage on weekends.  
She never charges much — sometimes nothing at all — especially for neighborhood kids.

One afternoon, a friend brings his old bike with a warped rim. She fixes it in fifteen minutes.  
He doesn’t have cash on him, but he pulls out his phone and says:

**“I’ll send you a tiny bit of gold.”**

A moment later, Jasmine receives **.00045 PAXG** — worth a few dollars, but carrying a kind of emotional weight that regular money never seems to have.

Not a transaction.  
Not a favor owed.  
Just a clean, simple **exchange of value**, honored in microscopic gold.

She laughs and thinks, *“So this is what modern bartering feels like.”*

Barter doesn’t die.  
It evolves — one tiny gold atom at a time.
