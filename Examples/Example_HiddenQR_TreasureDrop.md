# Example — The Hidden QR Treasure Drop  
*A MicroscopicGold Parable*

A local street artist in Chicago paints a mural of a rising sun over Lake Michigan.  
Bright colors. Clean lines. A quiet message of hope.

But hidden inside the pattern — barely noticeable — is a tiny QR code woven into the geometry of the clouds.

The first person to scan it with their phone receives:

**“Congratulations — you discovered a MicroscopicGold treasure drop: .00033 PAXG.”**

The news spreads word-of-mouth.  
Friends drag friends to see the mural.  
People take photos, zoom in, search the shapes like detectives.

Art becomes a scavenger hunt.  
Discovery becomes reward.  
A mural becomes a game.

The artist posts no explanation.  
Just a small caption:

**“Value belongs to the curious.”**

This is a TreasureDrop:  
**A hidden gift, waiting for the eyes that pay attention.**
