# Example — Tipping a Creator in Gold Atoms  
*A MicroscopicGold Parable*

Jordan uploads guitar tutorials on weekends — not a professional musician, just someone who loves helping beginners avoid the frustration he once felt.

He earns nothing from it.  
That never bothered him — until one day, after posting a new lesson, he receives a notification:

**“You received a micro-tip: .00027 PAXG.”**

A follower had sent him microscopic gold — not enough to feel like payment, but enough to feel like *recognition*.

Jordan stares at the message longer than expected.  
It isn’t the value.  
It’s the meaning.

Someone out there found value in his work and chose to express it with something timeless — a sliver of real gold, carried across the blockchain like a tiny thank-you note.

He smiles, picks up his guitar, and starts recording his next lesson.

This is creator tipping, transformed:  
**Gifts small enough for anyone, meaningful enough for everyone.**
