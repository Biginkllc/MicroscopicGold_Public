# From Unstoppable Domains to MetaMask to an Exchange

This guide shows the full lifecycle of PAXG:
Unstoppable Domain → MetaMask → Exchange.

It is designed for beginners and for live demonstrations.

## Step 1: Receiving PAXG via a Domain
- Someone sends PAXG to a domain such as weacceptpaxg.crypto
- The domain resolves to an Ethereum address
- The PAXG arrives on Ethereum Mainnet

## Step 2: Viewing PAXG in MetaMask
- Open MetaMask
- Ensure the network is **Ethereum Mainnet**
- Confirm PAXG is added as a custom token
- Your balance should now be visible

MetaMask is not a separate wallet from the domain — it is the interface to the same address.

## Step 3: Sending PAXG Out of MetaMask
1. Select **PAXG**
2. Click **Send**
3. Paste the destination address  
   (exchange deposit address or another domain)
4. Choose the amount
5. Review gas fees
6. Confirm

## Step 4: Sending to an Exchange (Optional)
- Only use exchange deposit addresses that explicitly support **PAXG (ERC-20)**
- Always send a small test amount first
- Wait for confirmations before sending larger amounts

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Using the wrong network
- Sending PAXG to a non-PAXG exchange address
- Ignoring gas fee timing
- Skipping test transactions

## Why This Matters
This flow proves that microscopic gold is not theoretical.
It can be received, held, moved, and exchanged — transparently and in real time.
