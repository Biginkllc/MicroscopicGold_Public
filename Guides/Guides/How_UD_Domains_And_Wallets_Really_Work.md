# How Unstoppable Domains and Wallets Really Work

This short guide clears up a common misunderstanding about Unstoppable Domains (UD), wallets, and where crypto actually goes.

## The One Thing to Remember

Crypto is sent to **wallets**, not to domains.

Unstoppable Domains do not hold funds.  
They do not create balances.  
They do not act as sub-accounts.

They simply point to a wallet address.

## What Happens When PAXG Is Sent

When PAXG is withdrawn from a platform like Crypto.com:

1. The sender provides an **Ethereum wallet address (0x...)**
2. The transaction is sent on **Ethereum Mainnet**
3. The PAXG arrives at that wallet address
4. MetaMask shows the **total balance** for that address

That wallet address is the final destination.

## Where Domains Fit In

Unstoppable Domains are **human-readable labels** mapped to a wallet address.

If multiple domains point to the same address, they all resolve to the same place.

Example:
- microscopicgold.crypto
- paxgdrops.crypto
- weacceptpaxg.crypto

If all three map to the same Ethereum address, then sending to any of them results in the same wallet balance.

Nothing is duplicated.  
Nothing is split.

## A Simple Analogy

- The Ethereum address is the **account number**
- MetaMask is the **bank app**
- Unstoppable Domains are **nicknames** for the account number

Crypto.com only sees and uses the account number.

## Why This Is Useful

Using multiple domains lets you present different purposes:
- Education
- Donations
- Payments
- Demonstrations

All while managing **one wallet** and one visible balance.

This keeps things simple, transparent, and easy to teach.

## Key Takeaway

One wallet.  
One balance.  
Many names.

Ethereum does the accounting.  
MetaMask shows the result.  
Domains make it readable.
