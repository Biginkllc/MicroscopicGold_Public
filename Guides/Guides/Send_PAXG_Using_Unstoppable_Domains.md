# Sending PAXG Using Unstoppable Domains

Unstoppable Domains allow human-readable names (like weacceptpaxg.crypto) to replace long Ethereum wallet addresses. When used correctly, sending PAXG this way is simple and reliable.

## What This Guide Covers
- Sending PAXG to a .crypto domain
- Ensuring the correct network is used
- Avoiding common beginner mistakes

## Before You Start (Required)
- PAXG is an ERC-20 token
- The network must be **Ethereum Mainnet**
- The recipient domain must be properly mapped to an Ethereum address

## Step-by-Step

1. Open your wallet (MetaMask or similar)
2. Select **PAXG**
3. Click **Send**
4. In the “To” field, enter the Unstoppable Domain  
   (example: weacceptpaxg.crypto)
5. Confirm that the wallet resolves the domain to an Ethereum address
6. Enter the amount of PAXG
7. Review the gas fee
8. Confirm the transaction

## Important Notes
- Always double-check the resolved address before confirming
- Start with a small test amount if this is your first time
- Gas fees vary — timing matters

## What Happens Next
Once confirmed, the PAXG is sent directly to the Ethereum address behind the domain. The recipient can view and manage it in any Ethereum-compatible wallet, such as MetaMask.

Unstoppable Domains do not hold funds — they simply point to wallets.
