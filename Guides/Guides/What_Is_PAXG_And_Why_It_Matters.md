# What Is PAXG — And Why It Matters

PAXG (Pax Gold) is a digital token that represents **real, physical gold**.  
Each PAXG token is backed 1:1 by **one fine troy ounce of gold** held in secure, audited vaults.

Unlike paper gold, derivatives, or promises, PAXG is designed to give holders **direct exposure to physical gold** — while remaining fully digital.

## Why PAXG Is Different

Traditional gold ownership has barriers:
- High minimum purchase amounts
- Storage and insurance costs
- Shipping, premiums, and delays
- Limited divisibility

PAXG removes these barriers.

Because PAXG is divisible, you do not need to buy a full ounce of gold. You can own **fractions** — even very small ones — while still holding value tied to real gold.

This makes gold ownership possible at **microscopic scale**.

## How PAXG Works (Simple Explanation)

- Physical gold is stored in professional vaults
- Each ounce is tokenized into PAXG
- The token lives on **Ethereum as an ERC-20 asset**
- Ownership is recorded on the blockchain
- Transfers happen digitally, without moving the physical gold

When you hold PAXG, you are holding a claim on real gold — not a synthetic copy.

## Why PAXG Matters for Microscopic Gold

Microscopic Gold is built on a simple idea:
**value should not require size**.

PAXG allows:
- Gold ownership without wealth
- Saving without minimums
- Transfers without borders
- Proof without trust in intermediaries

This transforms gold from a luxury asset into an **everyday store of value**.

---

## What PAXG Is *Not*

- It is not a stablecoin pegged to fiat
- It is not mined digitally
- It is not “paper gold”
- It is not risk-free

PAXG’s value rises and falls with the price of gold.

## A Note on Responsibility

PAXG relies on multiple systems:
- Blockchain networks
- Custodians
- Wallet software
- Exchanges

Users should always verify:
- Network selection
- Token contracts
- Platform support
- Current policies

This guide explains the concept, not a guarantee.
